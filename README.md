# Why Terminal Portfolio?

## Vision

Terminal-Portfolio invites talented developers to create stunning, command-line themed portfolios to showcase their skills and work. Command-line interface is a powerful and efficient tool for developers, and this project aims to celebrate this through the creation of visually striking and intuitively designed web terminal.

## Status

I am currently using this as my default Portfolio.:sparkles:

## How to get started with Open Source
Here's a quick run down on how to get started with open source, first of all let's know some basic terminologies:

- Git: is a versioning system that let's you store your code and code history on your local computer preventing loses and allowing sharing of that code
- Github: is a server that let's you store the history in a database
- Open Source: A project is said to be open sourced if you can see the code on GitHub
- Fork: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub, it gets added to your repositories
- Repository: A project on GitHub is called a repository
- Pull Request: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project, this consists of you editing a file in the project.
- Issue: An issue is a change that should be done in a project, can be a bug, a new feature or a suggestion to a project
- Branch: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace(main or master), it allows you to work on something without affecting the original code

Now you know some basic terms, let's get into how to get started with some resources to let you understand open source better:

- [Crash Course to Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics) - Video
- [A complete Guide to Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE) - Video
- [Guide to Open Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/) - Article

## Contributing

- Take a look at the existing [Issues](https://github.com/TechSpiritSS/Terminal-Portfolio/issues)
- Fork the Repo create a branch for any issue that you are working on and commit your work.
- Create a ** [Pull Request](https://github.com/TechSpiritSS/Terminal-Portfolio/pulls), which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.
- Add screenshots or screen captures to your Pull Request to help us understand the effects of the changes that are included in your commits.

## How to make a Pull Request?

1. Start by forking the [**Terminal-Portfolio**](https://github.com/TechSpiritSS/Terminal-Portfolio) repository. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/TechSpiritSS/Terminal-Portfolio/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a> symbol at the top right corner.

1. Clone your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Terminal-Portfolio.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the new project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Terminal-Portfolio
    ```

1. Set upstream command:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/TechSpiritSS/Terminal-Portfolio.git
    ```

1. Create a new branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b YourBranchName
    ```

    *or*

    ```bash
    git branch YourBranchName
    git switch YourBranchName
    ```

1. Sync your fork or local repository with the origin repository:

   - In your forked repository click on "Fetch upstream"
   - Click "Fetch and merge".

### Alternatively, Git CLI way to Sync forked repository with origin repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

### [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) for Syncing

7. Make your changes to the source code.

8. Stage your changes and commit:

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to commit `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to run the commands ```git add .``` or ```git add *```. Instead, stage your changes for each file/folder

    ```bash
    git add file/folder
    ```

    ```bash
    git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
    ```

9. Push your local commits to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin YourBranchName
    ```

10. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Alternatively to create a Pull Request using GitHub Desktop:

1. Open GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account.

2. Make sure you are on the "Current Repository" view. If not, go to "File" and select "Add Local Repository" to add your repository.

3. In the "Current Repository" view, ensure you are on the branch that you want to submit a pull request for. If you're not on the correct branch, use the "Branch" menu to switch to the correct branch.

4. Once you're on the correct branch, make your changes and commit them to the branch. You can do this by clicking the "+" button in the upper-left corner of the GitHub Desktop window, making your changes, and then entering a commit message.

5. After you've made your changes and committed them, click the "Push origin" button in the top-right corner of the GitHub Desktop window. This will push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

6. Now, go to the GitHub website, navigate to your fork of the repository, and you should see a button to "Compare & pull request" between your fork and the original repository, click on it.

7. On the pull request page, you can review your changes and add any additional information, such as a title and a description, that you want to include with your pull request.

8. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the "Create pull request" button to submit it.

**Note:** In order to create a pull request, you must have a fork of the original repository in your GitHub account and you must have made the changes in that forked repository.

## **Congratulations!** You've made your first contribution! üôåüèº

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards! :raised_hands:**
